# Ruby Gem Cache Debug Fix

## Issue
The Ruby gem cache was failing with permission errors when trying to install gems. The error occurred because bundler was attempting to write to the system gem cache directory `/var/lib/gems/3.3.0/cache/bundler/git` without proper write permissions.

## Root Cause
1. **Missing Ruby Installation**: Ruby and bundler were not installed on the system
2. **Permission Issues**: Bundler was trying to write to system gem cache directory without proper permissions
3. **Missing Dependencies**: The `psych` gem required YAML development libraries to compile

## Solution
1. **Installed Ruby and Bundler**:
   - Installed Ruby 3.3.7 and bundler 2.5.22
   - Added gem bin directory to PATH

2. **Fixed Cache Configuration**:
   - Configured bundler to use local `vendor/bundle` directory instead of system directories
   - Set cache path to `vendor/bundle/cache` to avoid permission issues
   - This ensures gems are installed locally in the project directory

3. **Installed Missing Dependencies**:
   - Installed `libyaml-dev` package required for the `psych` gem compilation

## Configuration Applied
```bash
bundle config set --local path 'vendor/bundle'
bundle config set --local cache_path 'vendor/bundle/cache'
```

## Verification
- Bundle check passes: "The Gemfile's dependencies are satisfied"
- All 271 gems successfully installed
- Gems are now stored in `vendor/bundle/` directory
- No more permission errors when installing gems

## System Dependencies Required
For future reference, the following system dependencies are required:
- `ruby` and `ruby-dev`
- `build-essential`
- `libyaml-dev`

## Files Modified
- `.bundle/config` - Added local bundle configuration
- `vendor/bundle/` - Local gem installation directory (gitignored)
